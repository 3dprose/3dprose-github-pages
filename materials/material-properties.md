## FDM filament material properties including chemical and thermal resistance

| Filament Material | Heat Resistance | Acid Resistance | Alkali Resistance | Petroleum Resistance | Flexibility | Brittleness | Hardness | Food Safety |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| PLA (Polylactic Acid) | Moderate, softens around 60-65°C | Resistant | Resistant | Not resistant | Moderate flexibility | Low brittleness | Medium hardness | Generally considered food safe |
| ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) | Moderate, softens around 80-105°C | Resistant | Resistant | Partially resistant | Low flexibility | High brittleness | Medium hardness | Generally not recommended for food contact |
| PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) | Moderate to high, softens around 70-80°C | Resistant | Resistant | Partially resistant | Moderate flexibility | Low brittleness | Medium hardness | Generally considered food safe |
| Nylon | High, softens around 170-180°C | Resistant | Resistant | Resistant | High flexibility | Low to moderate brittleness | Medium to high hardness | Generally not recommended for food contact |
| Polycarbonate (PC) | High, softens around 150-155°C | Resistant | Resistant | Partially resistant | Low flexibility | Low brittleness | High hardness | Generally not recommended for food contact |
| PEEK (Polyether Ether Ketone) | Very high, softens around 343°C | Resistant | Resistant | Resistant | Low flexibility | Low brittleness | High hardness | Generally not recommended for food contact |
| ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate) | Moderate, softens around 95-105°C | Resistant | Resistant | Partially resistant | Low flexibility | Low brittleness | Medium hardness | Generally not recommended for food contact |
| TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) | Low to moderate, softens around 60-70°C | Resistant | Resistant | Not resistant | High flexibility | Low brittleness | Low hardness | Generally not recommended for food contact |
